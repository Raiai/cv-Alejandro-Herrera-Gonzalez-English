## Alejandro Herrera Gonzalez

I am a self taught lover of python programing and artificial intelligences with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and a special taste for challenge. At this point my best achivement was to be able to create a artificial intelligences that could self taught without the interbention of a human been. I am looking for a job that challenge my knowledge of artificial intelligences with the support of an interdisciplinary group in an environment that encourages constant and rapid change.

## Skills

#### Hungry for learning

I am interested in follow and learn the latest trends about technology that can change significantly the standard of the current industry , also i am able to learn something new in a short period of time through the experimentation of try and failure, once i understand how something works i like to share that knowledge.

#### A business perspective

Before start a new development i use the perspective of a starp-up where the resourses are scarce and the enviroment is rapidly changing, this perspective allow me to create cost efficient solutions that could be implemented fast.

- I achieved this skill during my first 3 failed startups where i learned to invest the resources wisely. 

### Teamwork mentality.

I like to have the big picture of the business in my mind before start any development so one of the best ways to achieve this is with the team work spesially with those who has the oportunity to share with the final customer.
